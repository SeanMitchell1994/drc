# Dynamic State Network (DSN) Reservoir Computer 

* What is this?
    * A software suite to study and test Dynamic State Network (DSN) Reservoir Computers
* Test a what?
    * A Dynamic State Network (DSN) Reservoir Computer is a modified Echo State Network Reservoir Computer that utilizies the injected dynamics of a nonlinear/chaotic function to improve predictive and generative performance of nonlinear/chaotic time series
* Why exactly?
    * This repo is used for the study of the effects of nonlinear/chaotic functions on DSN RC, as well as their applications. Included here are Monte Carlo batch simulations, synthetic dataset generation scripts, and examples of applications
* Okay, how to use it?
